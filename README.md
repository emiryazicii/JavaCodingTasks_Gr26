# JavaCodingTasks_Gr26

## Overview

Welcome to the JavaCodingTasks_Gr26 project! This repository is dedicated to practicing frequently asked Java coding tasks collaboratively as a team of QA engineering students.

## Weekly Coding Tasks

Every week, your mentor Zack will share 2 or 3 different Java coding tasks. Team members will work on these tasks individually, each on their own branches.

## Project Structure

- **Branches:**
  - Each team member has their own branch for working on weekly tasks.

- **Naming Convention:**
  - Follow the naming convention for folders and classes as specified during mentorship.
